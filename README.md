## Installation

Clone the GitHub repository:

```

## How do I run this application?

Just open the index.html file.

In this version of the project, we have integrated some unit testing into the project.  You'll see the results of those tests at the bottom of the file.  It will show you if the tests are passing or failing.

## Credits

Please note that the current project is getting data from the Yelp API.  We did have to implement a proxy PHP page because we ran into some error related to the Same Origin Policy.  You can see the code for the proxy in the file yelp_proxy.php.  I did make it available from my Godaddy hosted website, so the current project works without the need of a server running PHP.
